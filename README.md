# Spark-3-Ability-Wheel-Swap-Mod
A mod that allows you to swap between two different sets of D-pad powers/abilities with R3, it also disables a hidden feature which was the target lock on because it messed with the camera when pressing R3, I didn't even know that input existed but turns out it does, so I don't think anyone was using it anyways, though I'm uploading the cs so that if anyone wants to make changes they're able to, like enable lockon again or using a different button/key or set of this

Full disclosure, I made this with a lot of help from chatGPT, I did look for help from Unity modders and Spark 3 specific modders, but they either had forgotten how to mod the game or couldn't help, Shoutout to Helixsnake and his Spark 3 Mastery Mode, it significantly streamlined the proccess and he resolved many doubts I have; I really recommend checking out his mod it's a great addition to the game

I don't think I will make any updates for the mod since the functionalities it has now are everything I intended for it, though if anyone is interested in any changes or has any suggestions they can let me know and I migh try and see if it can be done.

-Melonloader
-Spark the Electric Jester 3
