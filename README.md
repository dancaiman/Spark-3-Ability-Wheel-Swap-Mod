# Spark-3-Ability-Wheel-Swap-Mod
A mod that allows you to swap between two different sets of D-pad powers/abilities with R3, it also disables a hidden feature which was the target lock on because it messed with the camera when pressing R3, I didn't even know that input existed but turns out it does, so I don't think anyone was using it anyways, though I'm uploading the cs so that if anyone wants to make changes they're able to, like enable lockon again or using a different button/key or set of this

Full disclosure, I made this with a lot of help from chatGPT, I did look for help from Unity modders and Spark 3 specific modders, but they either had forgotten how to mod the game or couldn't help, Shoutout to Helixsnake and his Spark 3 Mastery Mode, it significantly streamlined the proccess and he resolved many doubts I have; I really recommend checking out his mod it's a great addition to the game

I don't think I will make any updates for the mod since the functionalities it has now are everything I intended for it, though if anyone is interested in any changes or has any suggestions (or runs into any bugs) they can let me know and I migh try and see if it can be done.

Requirements:

-Melonloader

-Spark the Electric Jester 3

Installation:

Just drop the Dll in the mods folder, take it out if you wanna run the game without it

Things to keep in mind:

-The mod might start you with predetermined sets, but you can change the powers of each of them to anything you want.

-I envisioned this mod to be used by those that already beat and/or those with more than 8 powers unlocked in the shop, I believe the mod works fine for a fresh save file, but I haven't tried it so I can't say for sure, I encourage everyone that uses the mod to make backup saves from the game before you install it, or any mods really, I'm 99% sure the mod isn't able to corrupt your save file, but like I mentioned, every other modder that worked on this game always encouraged everyone to make backup saves so take that as you will

-This is my first ever mod so If you run into any bugs or have any doubts on the functionalities of the mod let me know.

-the mod automatically creates a xml file in user data, that saves the changes you make to each set in the save files you use, it's supposed to be there so leave it there if you want the game to remember the changes you made

To anyone that looks at the code:

the mod utilizes an Asset bundle of the games powers so that it can change the icons in real time while in Levels, so If you see it in the code that's why, I refrained from uploading the bundle in case LakeFeperd wasn't cool with it but the release already has the bundle included in the Dll, If you make any changes to the code and want to build a personal iteration of it you can message me and I'll see what I can do

Hope you guys like it!
